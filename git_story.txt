This is my beautiful git story
Once upon a time there was a man
He went to github and made an account
Afterwards, he wrote a beautiful story in Sublime. 
It was so good he thought, why not commit this?
So he went to his git and did a git add followed by a gitcommit
But oh no, he got a git see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
So he looked and realized I need to give my gitcommit a little space
So he did a git commit again
And happily ever after lived the git story.
Now he's a git master and lives the git life.
